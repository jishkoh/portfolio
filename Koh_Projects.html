                        Hangman Project (CSP, January 2019)
                    </h3>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Creating a hangman game in Python 2.7
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        The goal of this mini project was to explore the use of
                        functions and loops in game creation. To make the hangman
                        project work, I used a simple "while" loop that would
                        check for the number of tries left, and exit the loop
                        when the variable "tries" was exhausted. Then, I used
                        two functions to allow input from the player and
                        analyze the results. One function would be called every
                        iteration of the loop, and that function would call a
                        check to determine if the guessed letters were part
                        of the secret word. One problem I faced was that the
                        function that processes guessed letters takes multiple
                        letters as its argument. In a normal hangman game, the
                        player can only guess one letter at a time. To solve this,
                        I created a series of filters that would prevent the
                        player from inputting either too many characters or any
                        special characters in the while loop. If the player's
                        input was filtered, the game would acknowledge that their
                        input was unacceptable and dock them a try for it. Additionally,
                        I used two files to store the secret words and scoreboard,
                        respectively. These files are opened and read whenever
                        the program requires them to be. Lastly, I imported
                        the library "colorama" to give the text its color, which
                        made it easier for the player to read. In this project,
                        I learned how to interconnect functions and troubleshoot
                        in a way that would allow the program to run smoothly
                        and be organized in a way that is easy to understand. I
                        also worked well with my partner in dividing up the tasks
                        such that each of us always had something to work on, and
                        that we could check each other's work.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            First steps in App development: MIT App inventor
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            The goal of this project was to explore app development
                            using MIT App Inventor. Since this was a blockly
                            language, my partner and I were aware that our development
                            would be severely limited. Nevertheless, we decided
                            to create a trivia app using the tools available to us.
                            One challenge that we faced was setting the correct
                            answers for each question and randomizing the order of
                            answers. Since .txt files can't be imported into App
                            Inventor, we had to use lists in the program itself to
                            store our questions and answers. The correct answers
                            from each list were simply the first item in the "answers"
                            list. However, if the answer list was simply displayed,
                            the answer would always be the first option. In order to
                            fix this, we used a random number generator to randomize
                            the position of each button. This allowed the answers to
                            be unpredictable and harder for the player to guess.
                            Because this was my first app-creation project, I learned
                            a lot about optimizing apps for devices of different
                            screen sizes as well as ensuring that the visual
                            aesthetic of the app was easy to read as well as
                            uncluttered. Overall, I really enjoyed this project,
                            and I look forward to furthering my experience in
                            app development.

                            self-sustaining aquaponics system. To do this, we created
                            a control system with a Raspberry Pi at its core. The final
                            product consists of two plant beds as well as a single
                            large tank, which holds the fish. The water in the system
                            flows in a continuous loop, cycling from the fish tank to
                            the plant beds and back again. Water Level, temperature,
                            pH, and light sensors send feedback to a Raspberry Pi,
                            which then sends the data onto a web server. My job in this
                            project was to link the sensors to the Raspberry Pi and
                            write code that would allow the output of the sensors to
                            be read and converted into actual measurements of distance,
                            temperature, pH, and light. I was also in charge of implementing
                            bell siphons into the plant beds (see documentation). These
                            two responsibilities helped me experience aspects of both mechanical
                            engineering and computer science. The biggest challenge that I faced
                            in this project was combining the programs dictating how each sensor
                            operated into a single, cohesive whole. This required me to learn
                            multithreading to solve the issue, and even then it took me a good
                            week to complete that code. In this project, I was actually a worker
                            instead of a leader, as my older sister was the one in charge of the
                            project. This was an unusual position for me, as I was used giving
                            orders and not receiving them. However, I managed to cope with this
                            new status and was able to complete my assignments on time.
