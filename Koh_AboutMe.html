                    <p class="card-text">
                        I've been asking this question to
                        classmates, adults in the workforce, and senior citizens for a long
                        time. Although their answers are specific and vary widely, they mostly
                        boil down to one grievance: missed opportunities. As an aspiring
                        software engineer and mechanical engineering enthusiast, I aim to make
                        the most out of field trips, volunteering opportunities, and personal
                        projects in order to achieve my goals. This means that time and effort
                        must be put in, and a quality product should come out of the experience.
                        Ensuring that I make the most out of every experience eliminates the
                        problem of missed opportunities while also allowing me to learn skills
                        that are invaluable in the workforce.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      I am experienced, charismatic, and self-motivated. As a senior at Dublin 
                      High school and president of the robotics club, I have a responsibility to 
                      lead and set a standard for my peers. My experience in the building and 
                      coding aspects of robotics has allowed me to acquire an understanding of 
                      science and math not taught in schools. My charisma as a team leader holds
                      our robotics team together, especially when we are all stressed out. My 
                      self-motivation dictates my time management of robotics, homework, 
                      and extracurricular activities such that everything is completed 
                      according to schedule while still allowing me to sleep at a reasonable hour.
                      These traits have, and will continue to benefit me in my exploration of 
                      computer science and mechanical engineering. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      Throughout my experiences as a robotics captain, I have learned that skill
                      can always be overcome by effort. As a captain with only two years of
                      experience in robotics, I have been overshadowed by other captains who
                      have been working in the field for much longer. However, knowing that I
                      had less skill motivated me to spend more time and effort into construction
                      and optimization of the robot. My robot performed at the same level, if not
                      better, than other robots in the competition, proving that my effort had
                      levelled the playing field. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                      My interest lies in the implementation of code and algorithms into 
                      mechanical structures. As a result, I have been constantly carrying out
                      personal projects which involve designing a mechanism, linking it to a 
                      microprocessor, and programming it in order to fulfil a certain task or 
                      function. I aspire to harness my knowledge of math, science and critical 
                      thinking in order to push the limits of what robots and machines can 
                      achieve. Design of a mechanism and creation of an algorithm both require 
                      sophisticated yet intuitive applications of mathematics and science. 
                      Critical thinking plays a vital role in both prototyping and 
                      troubleshooting a system. Combined, these attributes form the basis of a 
                      successful design. If you would like to find out about how I integrate these
                      qualities into my work, please feel free to explore my "Projects" and "Work
                      Experience" pages on this site.
