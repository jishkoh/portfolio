                What do you regret most in life? I've been asking this question to
                classmates, adults in the workforce, and senior citizens for a long
                time. Although their answers are specific and vary widely, they mostly
                boil down to one grievance: missed opportunities. As an aspiring
                software engineer and mechanical engineering enthusiast, I aim to make
                the most out of field trips, volunteering opportunities, and personal
                projects in order to achieve my goals. This means that time and effort
                must be put in, and a quality product should come out of the experience.
                Ensuring that I make the most out of every experience eliminates the
                problem of missed opportunities while also allowing me to learn skills
                that are invaluable in the workforce.
              </p>
              <p class="pt-3">
                I am experienced, charismatic, and self-motivated. As a junior at Dublin 
                High school and captain of the robotics team, I have a responsibility to 
                lead and set a standard for my peers. My experience in the building and 
                coding aspects of robotics has allowed me to acquire an understanding of 
                science and math not taught in schools. My charisma as a team leader holds
                our robotics team together, especially when we are all stressed out. My 
                self-motivation dictates my time management of robotics, homework, 
                and extracurricular activities such that everything is completed 
                according to schedule while still allowing me to sleep at a reasonable hour.
                These traits have, and will continue to benefit me in my exploration of 
                computer science and mechanical engineering. 
              </p>
              <p class="">
                Throughout my experiences as a robotics captain, I have learned that skill
                can always be overcome by effort. As a captain with only two years of
                experience in robotics, I have been overshadowed by other captains who
                have been working in the field for much longer. However, knowing that I
                had less skill motivated me to spend more time and effort into construction
                and optimization of the robot. My robot performed at the same level, if not
                better, than other robots in the competition, proving that my effort had
                levelled the playing field. 
              </p>
              <p class="">
                My interest lies in the implementation of code and algorithms into 
                mechanical structures. As a result, I have been constantly carrying out
                personal projects which involve designing a mechanism, linking it to a 
                microprocessor, and programming it in order to fulfil a certain task or 
                function. I aspire to harness my knowledge of math, science and critical 
                thinking in order to push the limits of what robots and machines can 
                achieve. Design of a mechanism and creation of an algorithm both require 
                sophisticated yet intuitive applications of mathematics and science. 
                Critical thinking plays a vital role in both prototyping and 
                troubleshooting a system. Combined, these attributes form the basis of a 
                successful design. If you would like to find out about my projects, read
