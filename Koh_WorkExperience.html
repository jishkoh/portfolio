                    <p class="card-text">
                        My work experience over the past few years has consisted mostly
                        of field trips, lectures, and summer programs. One notable experience
                        was my field trip to the partnership summit at SAP, where I had the
                        opportunity to shadow an account executive. This experience was useful
                        because it enabled me to observe how SAP used their representatives to
                        interact with and make deals with representatives from other
                        corporations. The importance of these Inter-corporate relationships
                        apply to all companies, regardless of their size. Another memorable
                        experience was my tour of the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at 
                        Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). Here, I was fortunate 
                        to meet a laser Scientist who showed us around and explained how the 
                        facility operated. The engineers there worked in a huge facility, and 
                        thus had to ensure that the facility was maintained, operational, and 
                        safe. This experience was useful because it allowed me to realize that
                        facilities such as this one can be used to advance the fields of 
                        science, medicine, and technology, and thus, progress stems from 
                        engineering.

                      On February 17th, 2017, I attended a lecture by Felicie Albert, an LLNL
                      scientist. She introduced particle accelerators and explained their
                      advantages, disadvantages, limitations, and capabilities. Then, she
                      revealed a project that her team had been working on - a laser wakefield
                      accelerator. This construction was designed to perform the same tasks as 
                      particle accelerators, while reducing the space occupied. This was an 
                      inspiring experience for me because the solution she presented was a 
                      direct application of the design process in the engineering field. This 
                      is something that I, as an aspiring engineer, aim to practice in my 
                      projects and in my work. During my time at COSMOS, a four-week summer 
                      program, I had the opportunity to attend Professor Raymond de Callafon's 
                      lectures. Professor de Callafon is involved in the department Mechanical 
                      and Aerospace Engineering, so his talks and lessons were of great interest
                      to me. Professor De Callafon took great care in explaining the physics of 
                      a ball drop from a ramp, which turned out to be much more complicated than
                      I expected. However, I managed to understand and extract the most relevant 
                      parts of the talks, and apply them to my final project. I was inspired by 
                      Professor De Callafon's knowledge and teaching skill, and I aim to be as 
                      effective of a leader and mentor as he was.

                      I have been very fortunate to have Jason Franco as my mentor as part of our
                      school's engineering mentorship program. Mr. Franco is president of his own
                      startup, JVF consulting, which has found success in the fourteen years that
                      it has been in existence. However, despite his successes, Mr. Franco has
                      taught me that what success is is not set in stone; it is defined by the
                      person who works for it. In other words, if I want to be successful, I first
                      need to determine what success really looks like. After much discussion, we
                      decided that an important aspect of success was interpersonal interactions
                      - that is, relationships with other people. In addition to teaching me about
                      success, Mr. Franco also gave me feedback on my resume and engineering
                      portfolio. I learned that the information in my resume and portfolio has to 
                      be concise and appealing. When writing a resume, one should put themselves 
                      into the position of an employer and determine if the resume looks appealing 
                      to them. This practice applies not only to resumes but also to applications 
                      for positions or colleges.

                      In my 8th grade year, I helped to found an organization called Fallon
                      Engineering Lab with the goal to teach middle school students the basic
                      principles of engineering and programming. There, I was able to act as a mentor
                      to those students, and helped them understand the concepts involved in working
                      with a Raspberry Pi. Since I already had experience working with Raspberry Pis,
                      I volunteered to build and program a microcontroller-enabled robot for the
                      class. My prototype ended up being the model robot for the students to attempt
                      to build. Since I was the one who built the robot, I was able to help the students
                      in a useful and effective way. This experience in mentorship also helped to prepare
                      me for my current officer position in our school's robotics club, in which I have
                      to utilize the skills that I have learned from my time volunteering in Fallon 
                      Engineering Lab.
